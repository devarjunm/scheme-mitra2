# Deployment runbook (draft)

This runbook describes a production-oriented deployment sequence. It is not a certification that the code or a chosen provider is production-ready. The local `docker-compose.yml` intentionally sets development mode, permits a synthetic demo farmer, seeds the unpublished source-candidate catalog, and uses local credentials. The farmer demo therefore has no published scheme results until named human reviewers complete the required source, document and ruleset sign-off and an authorized publisher releases records. **Never expose that Compose stack as a production deployment.**

## Required services

- Python application container built from the repository `Dockerfile`.
- Managed PostgreSQL reachable only from the application and migration runner.
- Authenticated Redis reachable only from the application for shared rate limiting.
- HTTPS reverse proxy/load balancer with a restricted, documented forwarded-header trust boundary.
- Secret manager, centralized redacted logs, alerting, encrypted backups, and a verified restore procedure.

No document object store is used: the app deliberately does not accept document files.

## Configuration

Use the environment variables in `backend/config.py`. Production startup fails closed unless the secret, PostgreSQL URL, secure cookie, Redis, and deployment allowlists are configured.

Minimum production choices:

```text
APP_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://<user>:<password>@<private-host>:5432/<database>?sslmode=verify-full
JWT_SECRET=<unique random secret, at least 32 characters>
COOKIE_SECURE=true
COOKIE_SAMESITE=strict
DEMO_MODE=false
SEED_SCHEMES=false
RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL=rediss://:<secret>@<private-redis-host>:<port>/<db>
TRUSTED_HOSTS=app.example.gov.in
FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=<exact trusted proxy IPs>
CORS_ORIGINS=
ADMIN_EMAIL=<first named administrator email>
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<one-time password, at least 16 characters>
```

Use provider-specific TLS and certificate options for PostgreSQL/Redis URLs. URL-encode special characters in credentials. `CORS_ORIGINS` can remain empty for a same-origin frontend; if set, each origin must be an explicit HTTPS origin. `TRUSTED_HOSTS` must be an explicit host list, not `*`. `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` must identify only the proxy hops Uvicorn should trust. Do not copy development defaults from `.env.example` or `docker-compose.yml`.

At startup, `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` create or promote a `SUPER_ADMIN`; remove the password from runtime configuration once the initial account is bootstrapped. Keep the database record and use normal account password reset/rotation procedures (a self-service password reset flow is not currently implemented). Do not use a shared admin account. A second reviewer must register a normal account and be identity-verified through the organization's approved out-of-band process (the app does not verify email), then a super-admin operator can assign `DATA_VERIFIER` through `python scripts/set_user_role.py --target-email <reviewer-email> --actor-email <super-admin-email> --role DATA_VERIFIER --reason '<auditable reason>'`; the CLI checks the actor role and writes an audit entry.

## Release sequence

1. Build and scan an immutable container image from a reviewed commit. Run the test suite and dependency/security scans in CI.
2. Provision and validate database, Redis, secret-manager access, backup retention, network ACLs, HTTPS, and proxy header behavior.
3. Run `python -m alembic upgrade head` once as a release/migration job, using the same image and database secret. Review migration SQL and take a recoverable backup before destructive changes. Do not run migrations from every app replica.
4. Start the app with `python run.py` for a single worker, or run Uvicorn directly with the provider-specific trusted proxy list and an intentionally sized worker count. Ensure the reverse proxy only accepts public traffic and strips/replaces incoming `X-Forwarded-*` headers.
5. Verify `/health`, `/ready`, HTTPS redirects/cookies, CSRF rejection, the authenticated farmer journey, role boundaries, rate limits, and audit writes from the deployed origin.
6. Sign in as the named super-admin; create/import official scheme records. The editor must record current source and document review, explain unknowns, and keep incomplete rule sets unattested. A different human verifier reviews each version; the API blocks self-verification by the last editor and requires a different account from the verifier to publish it. A published record becomes farmer-visible; it is still preliminary guidance, not an official government decision.
7. Remove bootstrap credentials, confirm admin MFA/identity policy at the infrastructure layer, and set an operations owner for incident response, security patching, data access, backups, and retention.

## Operations and unresolved work

- Monitor application errors, database pool saturation, Redis availability, authentication failures, rate-limit rejections, and backup/restore results. Logs should not capture passwords, cookies, raw documents, Aadhaar/bank data, or full submitted profile bodies.
- Expired session rows are not automatically purged by the web process. Schedule and monitor `python scripts/cleanup_expired_sessions.py --retention-days 30` (or a reviewed retention value); choose the retention period with security/privacy owners and test it against audit/incident needs.
- The repository includes password-confirmed account deletion in the mobile app and an external web deletion route, with backend tests for record removal. Before onboarding real farmers, the operator must review and exercise these flows, align backup-retention/deletion handling with the privacy notice, and define support escalation. Account export, email verification/password reset, MFA or an approved identity provider for privileged roles, security-event alerting, and formal data-retention controls are still unresolved.
- Keep the official-scheme allow-list, source capture, translation, and deterministic rule version under named human review. Check current official application status/window manually; there is no live feed.
- Complete threat modeling, privacy assessment under applicable law, accessibility testing, penetration testing, load/soak testing, disaster recovery, and pilot evaluation before calling a release production-ready.

## Rollback

Use an expand/contract migration strategy. Back up before upgrade; test restoring that backup to an isolated environment. Prefer rolling back the app image while keeping backward-compatible schema changes. Do not run an Alembic downgrade against production as an emergency action unless the rollback is explicitly reviewed and data-loss implications are understood.
